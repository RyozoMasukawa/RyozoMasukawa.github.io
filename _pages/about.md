Currently embarking on my journey as a first-year student in the esteemed UCI MS in Computer Science program, I'm passionately delving into the realms of technology and innovation.

Exciting news awaits as I gear up to transition into a Ph.D. program at UC Irvine's BIASLab, where I'll have the privilege of working alongside Professor Mohsen Imani starting fall 2024.

My research pursuits are driven by a profound interest in merging the intricacies of brain-inspired hyperdimensional computing (HDC) with the latest advancements in machine learning models. It's a fascinating exploration that promises to unveil groundbreaking insights and transformative solutions.

Looking forward to engaging in meaningful discussions and collaborative endeavors within our shared sphere of expertise.
