Hello! My name is Ryozo Masukawa, and I am currently a first-year UCI MS in Computer Science student.

I am interested in pursuing a Ph.D. and hope to gain machine learning research experience during my time in graduate school.

My primary research interest lies in the harmonization of brain-inspired hyperdimensional computing (HDC) and cutting-edge machine learning models.
