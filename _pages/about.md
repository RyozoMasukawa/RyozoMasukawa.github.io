Hello! My name is Ryozo Masukawa and I will be enrolling in the UCI MS in Computer Science program starting in September 2023!

I am interested in pursuing a PhD and am hoping to gain research experience in machine learning during my time in graduate school. If you believe I would be a good fit for a research assistant position in your lab, please don't hesitate to contact me at [ryozomasukawa0209@gmail.com](ryozomasukawa0209@gmail.com).

My primary interests within machine learning are reinforcement learning, language models, generative adversarial networks, and diffusion models.
