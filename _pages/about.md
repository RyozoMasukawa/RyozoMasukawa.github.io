Hello! My name is Ryozo Masukawa and I will be enrolling in the UCI MS in Computer Science program starting in September 2023!

I am interested in pursuing a PhD and am hoping to gain machine learning research experience during my time in graduate school.

My primary interests within machine learning are reinforcement learning that uses Brain-inspired hyperdimensonal computing (HDC).
